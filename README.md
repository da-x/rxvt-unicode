The master branch of this fork only contains this `README.md`.

I have stabilized support for 24-bit true ANSI colors in the following branches:

 * https://github.com/da-x/rxvt-unicode/tree/master-with-24bit-color
 * https://github.com/da-x/rxvt-unicode/tree/v9.22-with-24bit-color
 * https://github.com/da-x/rxvt-unicode/tree/v9.21-with-24bit-color

The original implementation was originally posted at:
